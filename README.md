Django is a high-level web framework written in Python. That means it's a toolkit for web developers that lets them build websites faster and easier.

Here are some of the reasons why Django is popular:
- Rapid development: Django provides pre-built components and tools that handle common web development tasks. This saves developers time and effort compared to starting from scratch.
- Security: Django is designed with security in mind and helps developers avoid common security vulnerabilities.
- Scalability: Django can be used to build websites of all sizes, from small personal blogs to large enterprise applications.
- Maintainability: Django code is well-organized and easy to understand, which makes it easier for developers to maintain and update websites over time.

Here are some of the types of websites that can be built with Django:
- Content management systems (CMS)
- Social networking sites
- E-commerce websites
- Data analysis tools
- And many more!
